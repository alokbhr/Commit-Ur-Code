<h1 align="Center">🖥️ Compute Coprime 📐</h1>
<h4>Question 7</h4>

<br>

You are given a range of positive integers **L,L+1,…R**. Find an integer ***X*** greater than **1** which is coprime with all the integers in this range (does not share any common factors greater than **1** with any of these integers). In addition, **X** must not exceed **2⋅10<sup>*9*</sup>**.

If there are multiple solutions satisfying these conditions, you may find any one of them. It is guaranteed that for the given constraints, at least one such integer ***X*** exists.

For example, if **L=16** and **R=17**, then **X=9** is coprime with both **16** and **17**. However, if **L=6** and **R=12** instead, then **X=9** shares a common factor **3** with **6** and **12** and a common factor **9** with **9**.

<strong>Input</strong>

*1*. The first line of the input contains a single integer **T** denoting the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.<br>
*2*. The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers **L** and **R**.<br>

<br>


<strong>Output</strong>

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ***X*** which satisfies the above conditions.
